# smartos-ubuntu

This is a collection of scripts to generate modern Ubuntu images for SmartOS. 

Since Joyent have [switched][0] to [Ubuntu Certified][1] images they have not 
published any recent Ubuntu images for SmartOS. There are guides online that 
explain how to install Ubuntu on SmartOS, but they do not provide the same 
experience that we have all grown to love from Joyent's images.
